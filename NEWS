backupninja (0.9.8-1) UNRELEASED

	* duplicity 0.6.01 and later defaults to using an archive (cache)
	  directory, which was previously opt-in. Starting with backupninja
	  0.9.8, the backupninja duplicity handler puts this cache into
	  /var/cache/backupninja/duplicity unless specified by the user with
	  the "options" setting the *.dup job.
	  When backups have been performed with backupninja older than 0.9.8 in
	  conjunction with duplicity 0.6.01 or later, e.g. when using Sid or
	  Squeeze at certain times of the Squeeze release cycle, cache files
	  were probably saved into /root/.cache/duplicity; one may want to
	  delete these files, or rather save bandwidth and just move the cache
	  directory to the new location:

	             mkdir -p /var/cache/backupninja
	             mv /root/.cache/duplicity /var/cache/backupninja/

	  It is probably desirable to exclude this cache directory from
	  duplicity backup sets to avoid some kind of reentrant backup problem.

backupninja (0.9.7-1) UNRELEASED

	* mysql: output filenames to support shell meta-characters in
	  database names. This change was not heavily tested, please
	  report any breakage.
	* pgsql: output filenames to support shell meta-characters in
	  database names. This change was not heavily tested, please
	  report any breakage.

backupninja (0.9.4-1) UNRELEASED

	* duplicity: Old (pre-0.9.4) example.dup file used to give false
	  information about the way the GnuPG-related options are used.
	  Please read the new /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.dup
	  file, and update your own configuration files if needed.

	* duplicity, rdiff: symlinks and globbing support in
	  include/exclude/vsinclude was unclear and did not work in all
	  situations, with weird behavious, due to incompatibilities
	  between various readlink versions in this field. This has been made
	  clear eventually: globbing is fully supported again, whereas no
	  attempt is done to dereference symlinks anymore. 
	  Please read the new /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.dup
	  or /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.rdiff file, and update
	  your own configuration files if needed.

	* duplicity: duplicity now uses sftp, which does not support all scp
	  command line options; you thus have to convert the sshoptions setting
	  in your *.dup configuration files, to sftp-compatible syntax; for
	  example, you can replace:
	    sshoptions = -i /root/.ssh/id_dsa_duplicity
	  with:
	    sshoptions = -o IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/id_dsa_duplicity
