	   sqldumpoptions configuration variable. Thanks to Chris Lamb for his
	   preliminary patch (Closes: #502966)
	 . Hide 'mysqladmin ping' output, to prevent confusing the user in
	   case mysqld is running but the authentication fails, which apparently
	   does not prevent mysqldump to work.
	 . Fix the error message displayed when mysqld is not running:
	   mysqladmin ping indeed returns 0 when authentication fails.
	 . Use gzip's --rsyncable option.
	 . Quote output filenames to support shell meta-characters in
	   database names.
	 . Use bash pipefail option when needed so that failed dumps are

	   run remove-older-than when $keep is not set to yes (Closes: #458816),
	   and run "duplicity cleanup" before any other duplicity command; both
	   only trigger a warning on failure, since they should not stop backups
	   from being done. Also migrated full/incremental backup switch to the
	   new syntax.
	 . Support every duplicity-supported transport with new configuration
	   option desturl (Closes: #483712, #346040, Trac#2).
	 . Actually allow to backup only VServers, by relaxing $include test.

	 . make maildir helper look in every subdirectory of the source directory for
	   maildirs, rather than just looking in the directories [a-zA-Z0-9], thanks
	   for the patch from chris@cenolan.com (Trac#43).
	 . make deleted maildirs record the date they were deleted
	 . add destid_file configuration option to enable you to specify an alternate
	   ssh public key authentication file (defaulting to /root/.ssh/id_rsa)
	pgsql, mysql, svn, sys:
	 . use new vservers_running function from lib/vserver (factorization++)
	sys:
	 . update for 2.6 kernels: use /proc/kallsyms instead of /proc/ksyms
	   (Closes: Trac#39)

	 . fixed catifexec function to actually work, also now passes the arguments
	   given to catifexec() to the called command (Thanks John Hallam!)
	 . Added more robust software RAID information capture by running mdadm
	   -Q --detail /dev/md?* because some people may have empty mdadm.conf files
	   (Thanks to John Hallam).
	trac:
	 . stop failing on all the trac backups if just one fails, this means
	   removing the temporary trac backup directories if they fail
	makecd
	 . updated handler for new toolset (genisoimage and wodim)

version 0.9.5 -- December 2, 2007
    backupninja changes

	   applied to fix #370396 broke this, especially for configuration files
	   created with permissions 000 by an older ninjahelper version.
	 . Enhanced portability for other platforms
	 . Added quoting because it was needed to prevent shell expansion, broking the
           toint function sometimes (Closes: Trac#11)
	 . Fixed reportspace option (Closes: Trac#10)
	 . Fixed ldap handler not recognizing database suffix (Closes: Trac#28)
    handler changes
	dup:
	 . Support duplicity >= 0.4.3 invocation syntax (--ssh-command option
	   is not supported anymore) (Closes: #447425)
	 . New tmpdir configuration option, very useful in case duplicity tends
	   to fill up /tmp.
        ldap:
	 . Fixed shell command quoting issues, missing 'then' clauses, cleaned up
	   compress=yes to be less redundant and not create empty uncompressed
	   file (Closes: #394935)

	   instead of on/off
	 . Fixed problem that caused combination of slapcat and compress to not work
	   together (Closes: Trac#29)
	 . Applied patch from romain.tartiere@healthgrid.org to fix the SSL/TLS options

	maildir:
	 . Added an examples file (Closes: Trac#23)
	 . Applied patch from Anarcat that fixes the cp/mkdir calls to not use GNU
	   coreutils options, as well as some bashisms (Closes: Trac#24)
	 . Fix test mode (Closes: Trac#25)
        mysql:
	 . Fixed case where odd combination of configuration options caused sqldump
	   backups to get overwritten with an empty file (Closes: #402679)
	 . Added 'nodata' option to enable you to specify tables that you want to omit
	   the data from a backup, but still backup the table structure. This is very
	   useful in cases where tables contain large amounts of cache data. See the
	   example.mysql for options, thanks Daniel Bonniot (Closes: #408829)
	 . Enhance code for selecting databases by asking MySQL not to give us the
	   header (-N), to not draw pretty boxes around the output (-B), send the query
	   via -e instead of a pipe and ensure MySQL listens to -B. Thanks to
	   Matthew Palmer (Closes: #452039).
	pgsql:
	 . Support configuring PGSQLUSER for real, and document it a bit; this
	   broken support actually prevented pgsql handler to work for VServers
	   (Closes: #396578)
	rdiff-backup:
	 . Added cstream support to allow for bandwidth limiting
	 . Handle "keep = yes" to disable old backups removal (Closes: #424633)
	 . Add configuration option to allow you to disable the version check
	   as in some instances this may be an ok scenario (Closes: #424632)
	 . Added local destination support to helper (Closes: Trac#4)
	 . Allow exclude-only configurations (Closes: Trac#21)

	sys:
	 . Fixed typo breaking things for VServers.
	 . Fix bug when vrootdir is on its own partition (Closes: #395928)
	 . Better sfdisk error and output handling: should now properly warn
	   when it does not manage to backup a partition table, and shut up when
	   it succeeds (Closes: #396632)
	 . Added option to not use sfdisk at all, useful for vserver/xen instances
	   that produce warnings about no harddisks found (Closes: #404071)
	 . Fixed example in example.sys to detail the __star__ in partitionsfile and
	   note why its necessary (Closes: #409192)
	 . Force C locale for sfdisk to ensure english words are found in grep
	 . Make directory where output is placed configurable, and create the parent dir
	   if it doesn't exist (Closes: Trac#1)

	   one email. Requires logtail, rsync, configuration of reporthost,
	   reportdirectory and reportuser in backupninja.conf. Configure cron to
	   run once a day, and individual backupninjas not to report by email their
	   status, then enjoy one email report from all hosts, rather than multiple
    fixed 'make install' bug that failed if /etc/backup.d already existed
    changed spaces to tabs in Makefile.am
    updated redhat spec file (thanks Adam Monsen)

version 0.9.4 -- October 6th, 2006
    backupninja changes
	 . Fixed bug in toint(), and thus isnow(), which caused it
	   to not work when run from cron.
	 . Recursively ignore subdirs in /etc/backup.d (Closes: #361102)
	 . Add admingroup option to configuration to allow a group that can
	   read/write configurations (instead of only allowing root). Checks
	   and complains about group-readable files only when the group differs
	   from the one in the configuration file (default is root as before).
	   Thanks to Martin Krafft for the patch (Closes: #370396).
	 . When determining which backup actions to make, find now follows
	   symlinks for $configdirectory
	 . Changed order of -s to mail for compatibility
	 . fixed permission stat call so it uses the --format supported by
	   coreutils (Closes: #382747)
	 . Added disk space report option (thanks Adam Kosmin)
    handler changes

	pgsql:
	 . Fixed inversed vsname emptiness check
	 . Fixed su quote usage to be more posixy
	 . Fixed shell expansion, thanks Thomas Kotzian (Closes: #363297)
	 . postgres user UID is now the one from inside the vserver if necessary
	 . Compress now happens in-line to save some disk space (Closes: #370778)
	 . $PGSQLUSER is used instead of hardcoding user 'postgres' (although this is the default)
	svn:
	 . Fixed inversed vsname emptiness check
	rdiff:
	 . Symlink and globbing support in include/exclude/vsinclude
	   clarification: globbing is fully supported again, whereas no attempt
	   is done to dereference symlinks anymore, due to incompatibilities
	   between various readlink versions in this field.
	 . Removed overzealous vsnames check
	 . Now works if testconnect=no and if $test is not defined.
	 . add $sshoptions config parameter in [dest] section of config so
	   connections to ports other than 22 can be made by adding the
	   following to the top of the handler config:
	   options = --remote-schema 'ssh -p REMOTE-PORT -C %s rdiff-backup
	   --server'
	dup:
	 . Symlink and globbing support in include/exclude/vsinclude
	   clarification: globbing is fully supported again, whereas no attempt
	   is done to dereference symlinks anymore, due to incompatibilities
	   between various readlink versions in this field.
	 . Removed over zealous vsnames check
	 . Does not pretend anymore that duplicity can work without
	   any passphrase
	 . Support duplicity 0.4.2 (with Debian patches applied; upstream's
	   0.4.3 will integrate them); documented how to write sftp-compatible
           sshoptions (Closes: #388543)
	 . Now forbid to (try to) include /.
	sys:
	 . Many more system checks were added, (thanks to Petr Klíma)

           symlinks for $configdirectory
	 . Stop checking helpers perms: both "make install" and distros packages
	   install them with appropriate permissions, it's overzealous to check
	   this at runtime, and is more complicated to do with current
	   admingroup option.
	dup.helper:
	 . Fix: signing was enabled with symmetric encryption.
    changed cron permissions to 644
    changed /etc/backup.d permissions to 0770 (for admingroup)
    minor documentation fixes
    improved RPM build process allowing 'make rpm-package' and 'make
    srpm-package' targets, also fixes permissions on man directories,
    cleans up RPM-related files during distclean, and adds default
    EDITOR for "autogen.sh -f" if none is set. (thanks Robert Napier)

        rdiff.helper:
         . fixed errors in create remote dir
         . code formatting cleanup (three spaces indent)

        is set to ldapsearch as this is safer

    you must set "method = slapcat". The new default is ldapsearch.
    ******************************************************************
