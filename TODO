you are working on it!

. Fix all bugs reported on the Debian BTS:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&data=backupninja&archive=no

. Fix all bugs reported on our Redmine instance:
  https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/backupninja/issues

. Make ninjahelper allow you to pick what type of backup you want (instead
  of just assuming you want local-to-remote, or push backups. Some people
  want local-to-local, or remote-to-local, or pull backups). This has been
  reported for the duplicity handler as Debian bug #346040.

. Allow vsnames "all" in the msyql handler.

. Factorize the rdiff.helper's connection-related functions into a lib, so
  that they can be used by dup.helper too. (NB: don't forget that the dup
  handler has a sshoptions configuration setting, that is often used to
  specify an alternative SSH key, or a specific IP to bind to.)

. Add an exclude option to database handlers so you can configure it to backup
  all databases, except for the excluded ones
